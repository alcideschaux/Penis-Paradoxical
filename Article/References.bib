abstract = {We are reporting a peculiar variant of penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) characterized by its peculiar deeply penetrating and burrowing pattern of growth. This low grade, verruciform penile neoplasm is similar to the plantar epithelioma cuniculatum originally described by Ayrd in 1954. Clinical and pathologic features of 7 patients are presented. There were 7 partial penectomies and 4 bilateral inguinal node dissections. The mean patient's age was 77 years. Grossly, the tumors were white to gray, exo-endophytic, and papillomatous with a cobblestone or spiky appearance. All cases affected the glans and extended to coronal sulcus and foreskin (average size was 6.3 cm). The hallmark of the lesion was noted on cut surface where there were deep tumoral invaginations forming irregular, narrow, and elongated neoplastic sinus tracts connecting the surface of the neoplasm to deep anatomic structures. The neoplasm invaded through lamina propria and corpus spongiosum and grew along the loose connective tissue of Buck fascia to involve the tunica albuginea and corpora cavernosa (average depth was 32 mm). Deeply invasive keratin filled cysts or crypts, on serial sections, showed to be connected to the surface tumor. Fistulization to the skin was also noted. Microscopically, the lesions corresponded to well-differentiated carcinomas with bulbous front of invasion. There were focal areas of higher histologic grade and more infiltrative and jagged borders in 4 cases. Inguinal nodes were negative in 4 patients in which groin dissection was performed. Carcinoma cuniculatum is a variant of penile SCC with distinctive growth pattern and should be distinguished from other verruciform tumors such as the verrucous, papillary, and warty carcinomas. Unlike most subtypes of penile SCCs and despite the deep invasion, none of the tumors showed groin or systemic dissemination at time of diagnosis.},

abstract = {A concern of surgical oncologists has been to find a method to select patients for groin dissection in penile carcinomas considering the high morbidity of this procedure. A promising methodology, in the identification of early metastatic foci by the sentinel lymph node technique (initiated in Paraguay in the 1970s), was found, using a static anatomic approach, to be associated with a recurrence rate of 30\%. Later, a dynamic method using radioactive tracers and peritumoral dye injection was introduced with an improvement in patients' outcome. Recurrences, however, remained high in most studies at a rate of about 15\% to 20\% except in few highly specialized centers with failure rates of 5\%. The technical sophistication, lack of multicenter reproduction, and cost of dynamic sentinel node biopsies preclude their routine implementation in developing countries and other approaches are necessary. Because histologic grade, depth of tumor infiltration, and perineural invasion (PNI) are considered among the most important pathologic prognostic parameters in penile cancer, we devised a Prognostic Index combining these 3 factors. In this study, we are evaluating the incidence of nodal metastasis according to the Prognostic Index score. Pathologic materials from 193 patients with penectomy/circumcision and bilateral groin dissections for invasive squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed. The Prognostic Index (ranging from 2 to 7) consisted in the addition of numerical values given to histologic grade (1 to 3), deepest anatomic level involved by cancer (1 to 3), and presence of PNI (0 or 1). Histologic grades were defined as follows: grade 1, carcinomas with minimal to no atypias; grade 3, tumors showing any proportion of anaplastic cells; and grade 2, the remainder tumors. The anatomic levels and their numerical values were: in glans, lamina propria, 1; corpus spongiosum, 2; and corpus cavernosum, 3. In foreskin they were: lamina propria, 1; dartos, 2; and skin, 3. PNI was evaluated as follows: absence of PNI, 0; presence of PNI, 1. Penile intraepithelial neoplasia (carcinoma in situ), or index 1, was excluded from the study. Mean follow-up obtained in all patients was of 81 months. The distribution of cases and rate of metastasis according to index scores were: 2 (1 case), no metastasis; 3 (17 cases), no metastasis; 4 (35 cases), 20\% of metastasis; 5 50 cases), 50\% of metastasis; 6 (47 cases), 66\% of metastasis; and 7 (43 cases), 79\% of metastasis. On logistic regression analysis evaluating various pathologic factors, Prognostic Index scores were found as the best predictors of inguinal node metastasis and patients' survival. Inguinal node dissections might not be necessary for patients with low indices (2 and 3). Nodal dissections might be formally indicated for high-grade indexes (5 to 7). Patients with index 4 should be individually assessed for nodal dissection. If sentinel node biopsy cannot be performed for various reasons the Prognostic Index might represent a useful pathologic guide to the clinicians in the often difficult decision to perform an inguinal dissection or not.},

abstract = {The incidence of penile cancer varies from country to country, with the highest figures reported for countries in Africa, South America, and Asia and lowest in the United States and Europe. Causes of this variation are not clear, but they are thought to be related to human papillomavirus infection, smoking, lack of circumcision, chronic inflammation, and poor genital hygiene. Most penile tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, and a variegated spectrum of distinct morphologies is currently recognized. Each one of these subtypes has distinctive pathologic and clinical features. About half of penile carcinomas are usual squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest corresponds to verrucous, warty, basaloid, warty-basaloid, papillary, pseudohyperplastic, pseudoglandular, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, and cuniculatum carcinomas. Previous studies have found a consistent association of tumor cell morphology and human papillomavirus presence in penile carcinomas. Those tumors composed of small- to intermediate-sized, basaloid ("blue") cells are often human papillomavirus positive, whereas human papillomavirus prevalence is lower in tumors showing large, keratinizing, maturing eosinophilic ("pink") cells. Human papillomavirus-related tumors affect younger patients, whereas human papillomavirus-unrelated tumors are seen in older patients with phimosis, lichen sclerosus, or squamous hyperplasia. This morphologic distinctiveness is also observed in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The specific aim of this review is to provide a detailed discussion on the macroscopic and microscopic features of all major subtypes of penile cancer. We also discuss the role of pathologic features in the prognosis of penile cancer, the characteristics of penile precursor lesions, and the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of invasive and precursor lesions.},

abstract = {Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is considered a loco-regional disease with a fairly predictable pattern of progression. Widespread dissemination occurs in at least one-third of the patients. Local recurrence (defined as the presence of tumor after a primary treatment affecting any remainder tissue, including skin, erectile corpora, or urethra) present in up to 30\% of the patients increases the risk of regional inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes metastases. The aim of this study was to identify adverse pathologic prognostic factors in patients with recurrent tumors. Clinicopathologic features of 81 surgically treated patients (25 with recurrent and 56 with nonrecurrent SCC) were evaluated; 56 patients (19 with recurrent and 37 with nonrecurrent tumors) additionally received groin dissections. Follow-up (2 to 372 mo, mean of 71 mo) was obtained in all patients. Comparison of recurrent tumors at the time of the primary diagnosis and of recurrence showed that histologic subtype and grade were identical in 76\% of the cases and converted to a higher grade tumor in 24\% of the cases, especially, in patients treated with local excisions and circumcisions. Most of the recurrences (67\%) seemed at or before 12 months. Comparison of recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors showed that high grade tumors (basaloid and sarcomatoid) tended to be significantly associated with recurrent tumors, whereas low grade variants (papillary, warty and verrucous) were more frequent in the nonrecurrent group; recurrent tumors invaded into deeper anatomic levels than nonrecurrent tumors. The incidence of inguinal lymph node metastasis was higher in recurrent tumors (79\% vs. 49\%, P=0.0272). Cancer-specific survival was of 46\% versus 76\% at 3 years of follow-up in recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors, respectively. Patients with recurrent tumors had a median survival of 2.9 years; no major changes in survival were noted after 3 years of follow-up. Mortality was higher in the recurrent group (56\% vs. 29\%, P=0.0188); 80\% of patients with high-grade tumors (basaloid, sarcomatoid, and high grade usual or hybrid verrucous SCCs) died from penile cancer. Mortality in patients with usual SCC was higher in the recurrent group, but similar in basaloid and sarcomatoid SCCs. After 3 years there was no survival difference in patients with low-grade recurrent tumors; however, in the high grade recurrent group there was a progressive and gradual decrease in survival from 2 to 10 years (median survival of 2.5 y). In summary, histologic subtypes and grades of SCCs were similar in the majority of original and recurrent carcinomas. Inguinal metastasis and mortality were higher in recurrent than in nonrecurrent carcinomas. Basaloid, sarcomatoid, and mixed usual-verrucous variants and invasion of corpora cavernosa or preputial skin were significant adverse prognostic factors of recurrent carcinomas. Local excision and partial penectomy were not adequate procedures for sarcomatoid and basaloid penile carcinomas. Carcinomas of foreskin had a better prognosis. Conversion from low to high-grade carcinoma was related to significant mortality. The identification of the adverse prognostic factors found in this study should be the base for an aggressive initial therapy to prevent recurrence in a subset of penile cancers. Re-excision of the recurrent tumor permitted the control of the disease only in one-third of the patients.},

abstract = {There is a group of low-grade papillomatous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the penis, collectively designated as "verruciform," that are difficult to classify. A proposal of classification grouped these tumors in warty (condylomatous), verrucous, and papillary carcinomas. Papillary SCC, not otherwise specified is the third distinctive type of penile low-grade verruciform neoplasms. We are presenting clinicopathologic features of 35 cases from 2 institutions. All specimens were penectomies or circumcisions. Mean age was 57 years. Sites of involvement were glans alone in 18 cases (51\%), glans, coronal sulcus and foreskin in 13 cases (37\%), glans and sulcus in 3 cases (9\%), and foreskin in 1 case (3\%). Papillary carcinomas were large (mean 5.6 cm) exophytic low-grade squamous neoplasms with hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis. Papillae were variable in length and shape. The tip was straight, undulated, spiky, or blunt. There was no koilocytosis. The interface between tumor and stroma was characteristically jagged and a moderate stromal reaction was evident in most cases. The majority of the tumors (94\%) showed a low-grade histology with focally present poorly differentiated areas in 6\% of the cases. The mean thickness of the tumor was 9.4 mm. The most commonly invaded anatomic levels were the corpus spongiosum and/or dartos (77\% cases). Corpus cavernosum was invaded in 8 cases (23\%). Vascular and perineural invasion were unusual. Frequent associated lesions were squamous hyperplasia, differentiated penile intraepithelial neoplasia, and lichen sclerosus (74\%, 46\%, and 34\%, respectively). Nodal metastases were identified in 3 of 12 patients with bilateral groin dissections. Of the 20 patients followed, 18 were either with no evidence of disease (15 cases) or died from unrelated causes (3 cases). One patient was alive with evidence of systemic metastases and 1 died from disseminated penile cancer 32 months after original penectomy. In conclusion, papillary carcinomas were exophytic albeit, often deeply invasive low-grade neoplasms, with a low rate of nodal metastasis characterized by complex papillae, irregular fibrovascular cores, and jagged tumor base. Papillary SCC should be distinguished from other penile verruciform tumors, including verrucous and variants, warty and papillary basaloid carcinomas, and carcinoma cuniculatum. Helpful morphologic features for differential diagnosis are provided.},

abstract = {Most penile cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, but there are several subtypes with different clinicopathologic, viral, and outcome features. We are presenting 45 cases of a distinctive morphological variant of penile squamous cell carcinoma composed of mixed features of warty and basaloid carcinomas. This tumor was earlier recognized in a recent viral study and showed a high association with human papillomavirus infection. However, clinicopathologic features are not well known. In this multi-institutional study, patients' mean age was 62 years. Most tumors (64\%) invaded multiple anatomical compartments, including glans, coronal sulcus, and, especially, inner foreskin mucosa. Tumor size ranged from 2 to 12 cm (mean 5.5 cm). Three morphological patterns were recognized: (1) the most common, observed in two-thirds of the cases was that of a typical condylomatous tumor on surface and basaloid features in deep infiltrative nests; (2) in 15\% of the cases, there were non-papillomatous invasive carcinoma nests with mixed basaloid and warty features; and (3) unusually, predominantly papillomatous. Invasion of penile erectile tissues was frequent, either corpus spongiosum or cavernosum (47\% each). Tumors limited to lamina propria were rare. Most tumors were of high grade (89\%). Vascular and perineural invasion were found in about one-half and one-quarter of cases, respectively. Associated penile intraepithelial neoplasia was identified in 19 cases and mostly showed basaloid, warty-basaloid, or warty features. Inguinal nodal metastases were found in 11/21 patients with groin dissections. Invasion of corpora cavernosa, high histological grade, and presence of vascular/perineural invasion were more prevalent in metastatic cases. In 21 patients followed, the cancer-specific mortality rate was 33\% with a mean survival time of 2.8 years. Warty-basaloid carcinomas are morphologically distinctive human papillomavirus-related penile neoplasms that, such as basaloid carcinomas, are biologically more aggressive than typical warty carcinoma from which they should be distinguished.},

abstract = {Histologic grade has been reported as an important pathologic parameter predictive of nodal metastases and outcome in patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. There is no consensus about the criteria for grading and the proportion of anaplastic cells required to classify a tumor as high grade. The incidence and management of heterogeneous tumors (tumors harboring more than 1 histologic grade) are not well established. The purposes of this study were to present a grading model for penile cancer, to test the practicality of the system by comparing a visual ("naked-eye") estimation of the proportions of grades with a digitally guided measuring system and to determine the influence on nodal metastasis of the various proportions of grades. A total of 117 penectomy and circumcision specimens with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissections were studied and 62 heterogeneous tumors were identified (53\%). The following steps were taken: (1) design of a grading system model; (2) determination of proportions of histologic grades by naked-eye evaluation and by digital measurement; (3) evaluation of metastasis according to proportions of grades; (4) determination of the influence of site of grade 3 in nodal metastasis; (5) design of a Gleason-like scoring system; and (6) statistical evaluation. We designed a 3-tier grading system. Grade 1: well-differentiated cells, almost undistinguishable from normal squamous cells except for the presence of minimal basal/parabasal cell atypia. Grade 3: tumors predominantly composed of anaplastic cells. Grade 2: all tumors not fitting into criteria described for grade 1 or 3. A visual and digital-based (slides scanned and the corresponding areas measured with an image-editing software) proportions of grades were estimated and the metastatic rate between them were confronted using different proportions of grade 3. To evaluate the influence of site of grade 3 on nodal metastasis, we selected 20 heterogeneous tumors. We established 3 sites: superficial, at or within the main tumor and deep at front of invasion. There was no significant difference between the visual estimation and the digital measurement systems. Heterogeneous tumors comprised about half of penile squamous cell carcinomas. The majority of the heterogeneous tumors were composed of a combination of grades 2 and 3 (68\%). No statistical differences were noted in the incidence of nodal metastasis when comparing tumors with various proportions of anaplastic cells (P>0.10 in all cases). Metastatic rate was significantly more frequent in tumors harboring any proportion of grade 3 as compared with tumors without grade 3 (58\% vs. 14\%, P=0.04). Any proportion of grade 3 was equally associated with a significant risk of nodal metastasis. A Gleason-like system showed a correlation of higher scores and rate of nodal metastasis. No predictive advantage was found when comparing the Gleason-like model with the proposed 3-tier grading system. The proposed grading system emphasized both ends of the differentiation spectrum and was based on easily recognizable morphologic criteria. When histologically evaluating penile carcinomas, we recommend a careful search of areas of grade 3. Any focus of grade 3 should be sufficient to grade the neoplasm as a high-grade tumor.},

Penile verruciform tumors encompass verrucous, warty (condylomatous), and papillary, not otherwise specified, carcinomas.

Inguinal lymph node dissection material was evaluated in 40 cases. All carcinomas were of squamous cell type and were classified as follows: usual type, 36 cases (59\%); papillary, not otherwise specified (NOS), 9 cases (15\%), basaloid, 6 cases (10\%); warty (condylomatous), 6 cases (10\%); verrucous, 2 cases (3\%), and sarcomatoid, 2 cases (3\%). A high rate of nodal metastasis and poor survival were found for the basaloid and sarcomatoid neoplasms (5 of 7 patients with metastasis, 71\%, and 5 of 8 dead of disease, 63\%). Only 1 patient with a verruciform tumor (defined as a tumor of nonspecific papillary, warty, or verrucous type) had inguinal node metastasis and none died from penile cancer. An intermediate rate of metastasis and mortality (14 of 26, 54\%, and 13 of 36, 36\%, respectively) was found for typical SCC. Penile carcinomas are morphologically heterogeneous, and there is a correlation of histologic type and biologic behavior. This mandates accurate histologic subtyping by the pathologist.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to identify prognostic pathologic factors which are independent from other clinical or molecular variables. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on morphological prognostic factors emphasizing our personal experience. RESULTS: We found that for a proper evaluation of prognostic factors a familiarity with penile complex anatomy is required. A biopsy of the primary tumor is not useful for a complete evaluation of prognostic factors other than malignancy and a resected specimen should be utilized. Penile carcinomas have a fairly predictable pattern of local, regional and systemic spread. Pathologic factors affecting patients outcome are multiple but it is difficult from the available studies using heterogeneous pathologic methodologies, different therapeutic approaches and ecologically variable patient populations to ascertain the independent validity of these factors. Invasion of perineural spaces by tumor, lymphatic-venous embolization and histological grade appear to be the most important pathologic predictors of nodal spread and cancer mortality. Other commonly cited factors influencing prognosis are tumor depth or thickness, anatomical site and size of the primary tumor, patterns of growth, irregular front of invasion, pathologic subtypes of the SCC, positive margins of resection and urethral invasion. A combination of two factors, histological grade and depth has been reported as significant predictor of cancer regional spread. After a preselection of significant factors, nomograms have been constructed to collectively evaluate the predictive power of various clinical and pathological indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Among various factors perineurial invasion, vascular invasion and high histological grade appear to be the most important adverse pathological prognostic factors.},

abstract = {Purpose: We determined whether histological factors of primary penile squamous cell carcinoma could predict the risk of regional lymph node metastasis. Materials and Methods: The clinical records of 72 consecutive Chinese patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis were analyzed retrospectively. Of the patients 58 underwent bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection, of whom 9 also underwent unilateral or bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Primary lesions were evaluated according to recently revised standards. The variables recorded were histopathological classification, histological grade, pathological tumor stage, invasion depth, vascular invasion, and the number and position of metastatic lymph nodes. Results: No patients with verrucous carcinoma had regional lymph node metastasis. However, 100\% of patients with basaloid, 33.3\% with warty and 30\% with typical squamous cell carcinoma had lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002). The rate of lymph node metastasis was 18.8\% in patients with pT1, as compared with 53.1\% in patients with pT2 or pT3 (p = 0.004). The mean depth of invasion was 9.3 (range 2 to 22) vs 3.2 mm (range 1 to 6) in patients with and without lymph node metastasis, respectively (p <0.001). Conclusions: Histopathological classification, pathological tumor stage and depth of invasion of the primary lesion are significant predictors of regional lymph node metastasis in Chinese patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. Combining these predictors can be used to select patients who are the best candidates for regional lymphadenectomy. ?? 2006 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {The ability to predict cancer progression may help the clinical management of patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. We studied 22 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis diagnosed between 1989 and 1998. The depth of invasion was measured from the basement membrane of the squamous epithelium to the deepest invasive cancer cells. Cancer progression was defined as the development of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis. The mean patient age was 63 years and the mean follow-up was 28 months. Ten patients developed cancer progression. The mean depth of invasion among patients with cancer progression was 9.8 mM, as compared to the mean depth of invasion of 4.0 mM among those patients without cancer progression (P =.02). Vascular invasion was also predictive of cancer progression (P =.02). Metastases developed in the majority (6 out of 7) of cases invading more than 6 mM, but developed only in a minority (4 out of 15) of cases invading 6 mM or less. We conclude that depth of invasion and vascular invasion are significant predictors of cancer progression for penile squamous cell carcinoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to identify independent clinical and pathologic variables that were predictive of lymph node involvement in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in a multicenter series with the intent to select patients who were suitable to undergo immediate inguinal lymphadenectomy.

METHODS: Data were analyzed from 175 patients who underwent surgery for penile carcinoma in 11 urologic centers participating in the Gruppo Uro-Oncologico del Nord-Est (Northeast Uro-Oncological Group) Penile Cancer Data Base. Pathologically positive lymph nodes were defined as the presence of histologically confirmed lymph node metastasis in patients who underwent either immediate or delayed inguinal and/or pelvic lymphadenectomy. Patients who had clinically positive lymph nodes with cytologically positive fine-needle aspiration results and who had not undergone lymphadenectomy were censored.

RESULTS: Overall, lymph-node involvement was observed in 71 of 175 patients (40.6\%) included in the analyses. After analyzing the whole group of patients, the following variables were identified as independent predictors of pathologic lymph node metastasis: clinical lymph node status, pathologic stage of the primary tumor, venous and lymphatic embolizations, and histologic grade. In the subgroup of patients with clinically negative lymph nodes, tumor thickness, histologic grade, lymphatic and venous embolizations, infiltration of both corpus spongiosum and urethra, and pathologic stage of the primary tumor (according to the 1997 TNM classification system) were predictive of lymph node involvement on univariate analysis. The generated logistic regression model showed that venous and/or lymphatic embolizations and infiltration of the corpus spongiosum and/or urethra were independent predictors of pathologic lymph node metastasis in patients with clinically negative lymph nodes.

CONCLUSIONS: Venous and/or lymphatic embolizations played relevant roles as predictors of pathologic lymph node involvement in patients with penile neoplasia and should be considered important parameters in determining which patients with clinically negative lymph nodes should undergo immediate lymphadenectomy.},

abstract = {Purpose: We evaluated clinicopathological features and outcomes in patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods: We studied 333 patients with homogeneous surgical treatment, including circumcision in 4, local excision in 2, partial penectomy in 194 and total penectomy in 133. Of the patients 153 also underwent bilateral groin dissection. Followup was 8 to 453 months (average 100). Results: The usual type of squamous cell carcinoma was noted in 65\% of cases. Higher histological grade, deeper anatomical infiltration, and vascular and perineural invasion were common findings in sarcomatoid, basaloid and adenosquamous carcinoma cases, correlating with a higher rate of nodal metastasis and mortality. These features were unusual in verrucous, papillary and warty carcinoma cases. Recurrence in 22\% of cases was common for the sarcomatoid, basaloid and adenosquamous types but was not noted for verrucous carcinoma. Locoregional relapse was more common in cases of usual, mixed, papillary and warty carcinoma, and systemic relapse was typical in sarcomatoid and basaloid carcinoma cases. The overall metastasis rate was 24\% and the 10-year survival rate was 82\%. The highest mortality rate was observed within the first 3 years of followup. High grade tumors were more common in penectomy cases and carcinoma exclusive of the foreskin had a better prognosis. The nodal metastasis risk groups were low-verrucous, papillary and warty, intermediate-usual and mixed, and high risk-sarcomatoid, basaloid and adenosquamous. Mortality risk groups were low-mixed, papillary and warty, intermediate-usual and basaloid, and high risk-sarcomatoid. Conclusions: These data should help clinicians to design therapeutic strategies and followup protocols. © 2009 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment of penile carcinoma is based on excision of the primary tumor and regional lymphadenectomies. Lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor, yet it cannot be reliably evaluated by imaging studies or clinical examinations; thus, new prognostic factors such as the pattern of invasion must be investigated.

METHODS: The data of 112 patients with penile carcinoma who underwent amputation and lymphadenectomy were analyzed. The clinicopathologic variables were studied, in addition to the front pattern of invasion according to the standards established by the modified criteria of Anneroth and Bryne first used as a part of a prognostic score in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. The pattern of invasion expresses the tumor-host tissue relationship, demonstrating the infiltrative tumor characteristics. This pattern was defined as infiltrating (invasion in blocks of small solid strands of cell tumors that broadly infiltrated the organ's stroma) and pushing infiltration (tumor cells have invaded large cell blocks with well-defined tumor-host interfaces).

RESULTS: The variables that were significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases on univariate analysis were clinical N stage (P = 0.011), lymphatic permeation (P <0.001), venous embolization (P = 0.025), and the pattern of invasion (P <0.001). In the multivariate model, the lymphatic permeation, clinical N stage, and invasion type were independent risk factors for lymph node metastases. The follow-up varied from 0.1 to 452.8 months (mean 76.9, median 27.3).

CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic permeation, clinical N stage, and standard infiltrating invasion were independent prognostic variables for the risk of lymph node metastasis.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Penile cancer has high mortality once metastatic spread has occurred. Local treatment can be mutilating and devastating for the patient. Progress has been made in organ-preserving local treatment, lymph node management, and multimodal treatment of lymphatic metastases, requiring an update of the European Association of Urology guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-based update of treatment recommendations based on the literature published since 2008. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search covering the period from August 2008 to November 2013 was performed, and 352 full-text papers were reviewed. Levels of evidence were assessed and recommendations graded. Because there is a lack of controlled trials or large series, the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation are low compared with those for more common diseases. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Penile squamous cell carcinoma occurs in distinct histologic variants, some of which are related to human papilloma virus infection; others are not. Primary local treatment should be organ preserving, if possible. There are no outcome differences between local treatment modes in superficial and T1 disease. Management of inguinal lymph nodes is crucial for prognosis. In impalpable nodes, invasive staging should be done depending on the risk factors of the primary tumour. Lymph node metastases should be treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in N2/N3 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Organ preservation has become the standard approach to low-stage penile cancer, whereas in lymphatic disease, it is recognised that multimodal treatment with radical inguinal node surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcome. PATIENT SUMMARY: Approximately 80\% of penile cancer patients of all stages can be cured. With increasing experience in the management of penile cancer, it is recognized that organ-preserving treatment allows for better quality of life and sexual function and should be offered to all patients whenever feasible. Referral to centres with experience is recommended.},

abstract = {Objectives: In penile carcinoma, the most reliable staging method for lymph node involvement remains radical dissection with its associated high morbidity. However, the patient's prognosis is closely associated with lymph node status, and radical dissection is potentially curative. We report our experience with surgical lymph node staging and evaluate which group of patients could be assigned to a wait-and-see strategy or dynamic sentinel node biopsy and which group should undergo groin dissection. Methods: From 1979 to 2004, 56 consecutive patients with penile cancer underwent surgical inguinal lymph node staging. On the basis of the histopathologic results, we defined risk stratification into low, high, and intermediate-risk groups according to the clinical examination findings, stage, and grade. Results: Tumor stage (P = 0.019) and tumor grade (P <0.001) correlated significantly with lymph node status. Stratification into low (pT1G1, pT1G2), high (all G3 tumors), and intermediate-risk (all others) groups found 7.7\% of low-risk patients with metastases. In the intermediate and high-risk groups, 28.6\% and 75.0\% had nodal metastases, respectively. Correlation with nodal involvement according to risk group was R2 = 0.608 (P <0.001). Conclusions: Risk stratification might enable a modified staging strategy for lymph node status according to stage, grade, and clinical examination findings. Highly motivated low-risk patients could be included in a surveillance program; however, high-risk patients should undergo bilateral inguinal dissection. Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy might be encouraged for intermediate-risk patients in the future. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose: The TNM classification is the most common tool for staging malignancies. The current classification for penile carcinoma has been unchanged since 1987. There are several shortcomings to this classification. Accurate clinical staging can be troublesome because several categories are defined by anatomical structures that cannot readily be identified by physical examination or imaging. A second drawback is substantial variability with respect to survival in certain T and N categories. We analyzed the prognostic value of the TNM classification in patients with penile carcinoma treated at our institute. We propose modifications to improve prognostic stratification and facilitate clinical staging. Materials and Methods: The records of 513 patients treated between 1956 and 2006 were analyzed. All tumors were staged according to the most recent classification. We calculated disease specific survival in the different T and N categories. Survival in the different categories was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank test. Results: Five-year disease specific survival in the entire group was 80.5\% at a median followup of 58.7 months. There was no significant difference in survival between T2 and T3 tumors (p = 0.57). Furthermore, no significant survival difference was found between N1 and N2 categories (p = 0.18). Using a modified classification a significant difference in survival was found among all T and N categories. Conclusions: The current TNM classification for penile carcinoma does not adequately differentiate in terms of survival among several T and N categories. With some modifications prognostic stratification improves and clinical staging is facilitated. ?? 2008 American Urological Association.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1996 to January 2007, 202 consecutive patients with penile carcinoma underwent surgical treatment at our institution. Of these patients 196 were studied to identify prognostic factors. All histological specimens were examined by the same pathologist. We considered certain histological parameters, including histological grade, invasion depth, lymphovascular embolization, perineural infiltration, infiltration of the corpus cavernosum or spongiosum, urethral infiltration and koilocytosis. RESULTS: Variables significantly associated with regional metastasis on univariate analysis were stage stratification (p = 0.0338), histological grade (p = 0.0112), invasion depth (0.0114), lymphovascular embolization (p <0.0001), perineural infiltration (p = 0.0092), corpora cavernosa infiltration (p = 0.0005) and koilocytosis (p = 0.0013). In the multivariable model lymphovascular embolization and absent koilocytosis were independent risk factors for lymphatic metastasis (p = 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). We also found a better survival rate in patients with koilocytosis and without lymphovascular embolization (p = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively).

abstract = {PURPOSE: We determine if histopathological factors of the primary penile tumor can stratify the risk of the development of inguinal lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of 48 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis who underwent resection of the primary lesion and either inguinal lymph node dissection or were observed for signs of recurrence (median followup 59 months) were reviewed. Parameters examined included pathological tumor stage, quantified depth of invasion and tumor thickness, histological and nuclear grade, percentage of poorly differentiated cancer in the primary tumor, number of mitoses and presence or absence of vascular invasion. Variables were compared in 18 lymph node positive and 30 lymph node negative cases. RESULTS: Pathological tumor stage, vascular invasion and presence of greater than 50\% poorly differentiated cancer were the strongest predictors of nodal metastasis on univariate and multivariate regression analyses. None of 15 pT1 tumors exhibited vascular invasion or lymph node metastases. Of 33 patients with pT2 or greater tumors 21 (64\%) had vascular invasion and 18 (55\%) had metastases. Only 4 of 25 patients (15\%) with 50\% or less poorly differentiated cancer in the penile tumor had metastases compared with 14 of 23 patients (61\%) with greater than 50\% poorly differentiated cancer (p = 0.001). No other variables tested were significantly different among the patient cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological stage of the penile tumor, vascular invasion and greater than 50\% poorly differentiated cancer were independent prognostic factors for inguinal lymph node metastasis. Prophylactic lymphadenectomy in compliant patients with pT1 lesions without vascular invasion and 50\% or less poorly differentiated cancer does not appear warranted.},

A total of 37 consecutive patients were included in a prospective study in which the same criteria for risk group allocation and the same therapeutic recommendations were used as in the retrospective study. RESULTS: In the prospective study we noted positive lymph nodes in 11\% of stage T1, 63\% of stages T2-3, 15\% of grade 1, 67\% of grade 2 and 75\% of grade 3 cases. The incidence of positive nodes was 0\% in the low, 83.3\% in the high and 33.3\% in the intermediate risk group. These rates were similar to those in the retrospective study with no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive value of the association of local tumor stage and grade for occult lymph node micrometastasis was validated in a prospective study. This factor allows the differentiation of 3 risk groups of patients with high reliability in the low and high risk groups. However, other prognostic factors are needed in the intermediate risk group to improve the prediction of lymph node involvement.},

abstract = {Penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) invading to a depth inferior to 5 mm usually have very low risk for regional metastasis, whereas tumors thicker than 10 mm have a high metastatic potential. A significant number of squamous cell carcinomas, however, belong to an intermediate category (5 to 10 mm in thickness) in which the incidence of regional lymph node metastasis is very difficult to predict. Consequently, a frequent clinical dilemma is whether to perform or not inguinal dissection in this group of lesions. The objective of this study was to evaluate multiple risk factors for regional metastasis in tumors 5 to 10-mm thick. One hundred thirty-four partial penectomies with invasive carcinomas 5 to 10-mm thick, all of which with corresponding inguinal lymph node dissection, were evaluated. Factors evaluated were--patient's age, anatomic site, histologic grade, tumor thickness, anatomic levels of invasion, and vascular and perineural invasion. Grades were classified as 1, well; 2, moderately; and 3, poorly differentiated. To evaluate independent significance of various prognostic factors, a logistic regression analysis was performed, and a nomogram was prepared to evaluate metastatic risk according to histologic grade and perineural invasion. Groin metastasis was found in 66 of 134 patients (49\%). High histologic grade and perineural invasion were statistically significant pathologic factors associated with groin metastasis. Nodal metastases were found in 2 of 25 grade 1 (8\%), 24 of 46 grade 2 (52\%), and 40 of 63 grade 3 carcinomas (63\%) (P value 0.0001). Of 48 patients with perineural invasion, metastasis was found in 33 cases (69\%) (P value 0.001). The average tumor thickness, anatomic level of invasion, and presence of vascular invasion were not statistically significantly different in metastasizing and nonmetastasizing neoplasms. Fifty percent of tumors invading 5 to 10 mm were not associated with metastasis and may be spared a nodal dissection. In this subset of patients, high histologic grade and perineural invasion were significant and useful risk factors associated with regional metastasis. The probability of inguinal node metastasis in patients with grade 1 tumors without perineural invasion is almost nonexistent whereas for high-grade tumors associated with perineural invasion is near 80\%.},

abstract = {Sarcomatoid carcinomas are uncommon, high-grade tumors, predominantly composed of spindle cells. Only a few cases arising in the penis have been reported. The aim of this study is to better define the clinicopathologic features of this neoplasm. A total of 400 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis were reviewed from which 15 sarcomatoid carcinomas (4\%) were identified. Clinical and pathologic features were evaluated in all cases. Immunohistochemical studies for expression of AE1/AE3, Cam 5.2, 34betaE12, EMA, vimentin, muscle specific actin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100, p63, and p53 and in situ hybridization studies for HPV were performed in 5 cases. Information about lymph node status was available in 9 cases, and follow-up in 5 cases. The mean age was 59 years, and mean tumor size was 5 cm. Grossly, most tumors were large, polypoid, and ulcerated masses frequently affecting the glans (93\%) and deeply invading corpora cavernosa (80\%) and skin. Microscopically, the lesions were predominantly composed of atypical spindle cells disposed in interlacing fascicles, resembling fibrosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma, sometimes admixed with pleomorphic giant cells mimicking malignant fibrous histiocytoma. One case was predominantly composed of myxoid areas. Less frequent and focal patterns were pseudoangiomatous and epithelioid. Mitotic figures were numerous, and necrosis was prominent. Foci of heterologous differentiation toward bone (osteosarcomatous component) were present in 1 case. Four cases showed a minor mixed component of usual, papillary, verrucous, and basaloid carcinoma. Intrapenile metastasis ("satellitosis") was present in 4 tumors. One of the cases was multicentric with a separate independent focus of well-differentiated carcinoma with pseudohyperplastic features. Associated low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were noted in 73\% of the cases. Immunohistochemical studies and HPV in situ hybridization were done in 5 cases. The spindle cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and p53 and showed at least intermediate expression of 34betaE12 and p63 in all cases. EMA and AE1/AE3 were focally positive in 60\% of the cases, and Cam 5.2 was focally positive in 1 case. Tumor cells failed to express muscle specific actin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and S-100. HPV in situ hybridization was negative in all cases. Inguinal metastases were present in 89\% of the cases. Two of five patients with adequate follow-up died of disease within 8 months of the diagnoses. In conclusion, penile sarcomatoid carcinomas are unusual, large, and aggressive tumors usually associated with lymph node metastasis and poor outcome. Differential diagnoses include sarcoma and melanoma. Cytokeratin 34betaE12 and p63 appear to be the more specific and sensitive markers to categorize these tumors as epithelial. Diffuse immunoreactivity for p53, compared with a more basal and focal reactivity in differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, may be indicative of a late mutation in the natural progression of the disease.},
